•	 As Python is a key subject in our curriculum in this semester, we have used Python as a backend coding language, HTML as front end, SQLite as database, mini web server cross platform  XAMPP Server, Common Gateway Interface in Python to exchanged data between the web server and Python, and using  Python Package Index (PyPI) to integrate Microsoft Word create a web application for Inventory Management System.
•	We have utilized a 64-bit i5 processor on a Windows 10 operating system.
•	We have studied the existing manual process of KMCE Indent Management System and acquired domain knowledge, carryout feasibility study, Created Database and using object oriented features in python, developed a web based application to meet many requirements including:
1.Creation of database in SQLite to store inventory related data by created tables and normalizing them up to 3NF.
2.Authorized members (Director, HOD, Store Keeper, Indent               Manager) of KMCE will be able to have access to this web app.    Appropriate web pages will be visible according to the ROLE of      person who is logging in.
3.Various departments (All Engineering branch HODs, Accounts, Admin, Security and Stores) will be able to place their requirements for items.
4.Indent form in MS Word have been generated with details like items, supplier and approximate cost in the prescribed format.
